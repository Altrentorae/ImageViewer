# ImageViewer

## What?

ImageViewer is a WIP C# .NET Windows Form used for displaying images, it is intended for displaying a large collection of images in a random order. It also supports videos.

## Why?

This project was made because I wanted an ultra-lightweight image viewing software that had certain features.

### What features?

* Ability to load thousands of image files without much overhead
* Arrow Key control of image cycling
* Automatic cycling with adjustable timer
* Completely random ordering of images
* Ability to jump to random or specific index in the list of images
* More selective file opening
* Built in video player
* Customisation of Window colouration
* Additive image loading (Options)
* Adjustable sort settings (Date Created / Last modified / FileSystem)
* Drag and drop image loading
* Remembers most settings in-folder.

## Addendum

* This has not been tested extensively, certain things may cause critical exceptions to be thrown. If you find one that you cannot fix, create an issue.

* If a video or gif fails to load, it's most likely an issue with the axWindowsMediaPlayer, and cannot be resolved. Sorry!

* This project is quite hard to work with, and may be rewritten at some point in the near future

* This project does not have a release download, if you wish to use it before release please build it yourself. If you wish to help the development process feel free to fix some issues and open a pull request.

* This is a project that I have worked on-and-off for the last year or so, it was never intended for public use but I changed my mind. Some things may not work as you may expect, I do not have a UX designer on hand.
